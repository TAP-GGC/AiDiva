                            f"- If this object is a **physical thing** that can be grabbed, held, or carried (e.g., telescope, book, phone), answer 'Yes, this object can be held.' "
                            f"- If the object is **too large** to be carried (e.g., car, house, mountain), answer 'No, this object is too big to be carried.' "
                            f"- If the object is **not tangible** (e.g., Wi-Fi, time, an idea), answer 'No, this object cannot be physically grabbed.' "
                            f"- Consider the object's **size, function, category, shape, material, and common uses** before answering. "
                            f"- If the object is **big** (e.g., tree, house, car, elephant, airplane), answer 'Yes, this object is large. üòè' "
                            f"- If the object is **small** (e.g., coin, phone, key), answer 'Yes, this object is small and easy to carry. üòè' "
                            f"- If the object **varies in size** (e.g., book, box, ball), answer 'It depends! This object comes in different sizes. üòè' "
                            f"- If this object is **commonly used in a certain situation** (e.g., an umbrella in the rain), answer 'Yes, this object is designed for that use.' "
                            f"- If the object is **not used for that purpose**, answer 'No, this object is not typically used for that.' "
                            f"- If the object is **food** (e.g., banana, pizza, cupcake), answer 'Yes, this object is a type of food. üòè' "
                            f"- If the object is **not food** (e.g., unicycle, book, phone), answer 'No, this object is not food. üòè' "
                            f"- If the object **has wheels** (e.g., unicycle, car, bicycle), answer 'Yes, this object has wheels. üòè' "
                            f"- If the object **does not have wheels**, answer 'No, this object does not have wheels. üòè' "
                            f"- Consider its shape, material, color, and function before answering. "
                            f"- If unsure, say 'I‚Äôm not sure, but keep guessing! üòè'. "
                            f"- NEVER ignore valid questions or default to 'Nope, that's not it!' unless the answer is truly 'No'. "

                            f"### Answer Examples: "
                            f"- If the object is 'umbrella' and the user asks 'Is it used in the rain?', respond with 'Yes, this object can be used in the rain. üòè' "
                            f"- If the object is 'television' and the user asks 'Can it be found in a house?', respond with 'Yes, this object is commonly found in homes. üòè' "
                            f"- If the object is 'television' and the user asks 'Is it rectangular?', respond with 'Yes, this object is typically rectangular. üòè' "
                            f"- If the object is 'banana' and the user asks 'Is it food?', respond with 'Yes, this object is a type of food. üòè' "
                            f"- If the object is 'cupcake' and the user asks 'Is it sweet?', respond with 'Yes, this object is known for being sweet and delicious. üòè' "
                            f"- If the object is 'balloon' and the user ask 'is it round', respond with 'Yes, this object is round."

                            f"- If the user asks 'Is it {secret_object}?', respond with 'üéâ Yes! You got it right! You must be psychic! üòè' and end the game."
                            f"- If the user asks a completely unrelated question (e.g., 'What‚Äôs your favorite color?'), respond with 'Let's stay on topic! Ask a yes/no question. üòè' "
                            f"- If the user asks a vague or open-ended question (e.g., 'Tell me about it'), respond with 'Ask me a yes/no question to learn more! üòè' "
